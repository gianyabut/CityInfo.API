"# CityInfo.API" 

Sample Project using ASP.Net Core and EF Core.

This includes the usage of IoC, EF Migrations using Extension methods, separate configurations per environment,
error logging to a file and sample usage of AutoMapper. 

Btw, migrations are already enabled to automatically generate the DB, just make a get request to 
this api: http://localhost:{portnumber}/api/testdatabase.

Cheers!
